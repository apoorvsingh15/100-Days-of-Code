The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys.
Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

Example of a map:

const map1 = new Map();

- Setting a value in the map:

map1.set("Apoorv", {age: 28, weight: 70})

map1.get("Apoorv"); // {age: 28, weight: 70}


Unique Usage from Objects:

A Map does not contain any keys by default. It only contains what is explicitly put into it.
A Map is safe to use with user-provided keys and values. - prevents object injection attacks.
A Map's keys can be any value (including functions, objects, or any primitive).
The keys in Map are ordered in a simple, straightforward way:
 A Map object iterates entries, keys, and values in the order of entry insertion.
 The number of items in a Map is easily retrieved from its size property. // inbuilt function
