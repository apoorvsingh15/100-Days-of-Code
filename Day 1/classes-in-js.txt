What are classes?

- Classes are templates for creating objects.
- They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
- Classes can be called as "special functions".
- A class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.
- The body of a class is executed in strict mode even without the "use strict" directive.

A class element can be characterized by three aspects:

Kind: Getter, setter, method, or field

Location: Static or instance

Visibility: Public or private

Example of a class declaration:

class Person{
  // body of the class - here we define methods or constructors
  constructor(name, age){ // Special method for initialising an object created with a class.
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  }
}

Example of a class expression:

const Person = class {
  constructor(name, age){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

Expression; the class has its own name

const Rectangle = class Rectangle2 {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
};
